            <p>
                I studied math in college and received my Bachelor's. I've taken a few coding classes before.
                Over the years I've worked in several restaurants and most recently at Red Robin.

                <h1>Recent Work</h1>
                Before attending Grand Circus, I worked to get my Oracle Certified Associate
                certification. I got it after a difficult exam and learning from a couple of Udemy courses.
                I'm currently learning how to code and you can see my projects
